# Contributing to ccusage

This guide exists to save maintainers and contributors time.

## The One Rule

**You must understand your change.** If you cannot explain what your code does and how it interacts with the rest of the project, the PR may be closed.

Using AI tools is fine. Submitting generated output that you have not reviewed and cannot explain is not.

If you use an agent, run it from the repository root so it picks up `CLAUDE.md` and the repo-local skills.

## Quality Bar For Issues

Use one of the GitHub issue templates.

- Keep it concise.
- Write in your own voice.
- State the bug or request clearly.
- Explain why it matters.
- If you want to implement the change yourself, say so.

Maintainers may close low-signal, unclear, or duplicate issues.

## Before Submitting a PR

Before submitting a PR, run:

```bash
just install
just fmt
just typecheck
just test
```

`just install` is only needed once per checkout (and after a lockfile change);
`git wt` runs it for you when it creates a worktree.

Use the canonical `ccusage` command in docs and tests. Standalone wrapper packages such as `ccusage-codex`, `ccusage-opencode`, `ccusage-amp`, and `ccusage-pi` have been removed and should not be reintroduced.

Do not proactively create documentation files unless the change requires user-facing documentation.

## Commit and PR Titles

Commits and PR titles follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). When a change
belongs to one agent, the scope is that agent's directory name under `rust/adapters/` — `fix(kimi): ...`,
`feat(codex): ...` — rather than a label invented for the occasion.

A `commit-msg` hook checks commit subjects against staged files. Follow the same format for PR titles because
a squash merge turns the title into the commit that lands on `main`.

## FAQ

### Why might an issue get no reply?

Low-signal issues, unclear reports, duplicates, and issues that do not follow this guide may be closed without discussion. A reply is maintenance work too.

### Is AI-generated code banned?

No. AI assistance is allowed. The requirement is that the contributor understands the change, tests it, and can explain it in their own words.
